# Marioclub - A simple website to practice and review HTML and CSS concepts

This project is a simple website that I worked through using the [HTML & CSS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu-q2zYwEYs) from Youtube in order to learn about HTML and CSS from the ground up including: semantics, CSS Layout & Positioning, Pseudo Classes & Elements and Media Queries.
